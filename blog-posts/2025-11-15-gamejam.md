# Game Jam Retrospective - 48 Hours of Chaos

Last weekend I participated in my first game jam using my custom C++ engine. It was exhausting, exhilarating, and incredibly educational.

## The Challenge

Build a complete game in 48 hours. Theme: "Merge"

## What Went Right

**My engine actually worked!** All those months of development paid off. I had:
- A working renderer
- A basic physics system  
- Audio playback
- Input handling

Being able to prototype rapidly in C++ (yes, really!) meant I could iterate fast.

## What Went Wrong

**Scope creep is real.** I spent the first 6 hours planning a massive game before realizing I needed to cut 90% of my ideas.

**No asset pipeline.** Loading textures manually via code is painful. Need to build proper tools.

**Sleep deprivation makes bugs.** At 3 AM, I spent an hour debugging an issue that was just a typo.

## The Numbers

- 5,832 lines of game code
- 14 hours of actual coding
- 6 hours of debugging
- 4 hours of sleep
- 1 completed game

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start small.** Build the core loop first, then add features
2. **Tools matter.** Good developer experience makes you faster
3. **Constraints breed creativity.** Limited time forced me to focus
4. **Finishing is a skill.** Cutting features to ship is hard but necessary

## Would I Do It Again?

Absolutely. Game jams are like intense training montages for game development. You learn more in 48 hours than in months of casual development.

Plus, there's something magical about building something complete from scratch in a weekend.
