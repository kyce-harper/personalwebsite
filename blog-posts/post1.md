# First Time Vibecoding
I wanted a quick Personal Website up and this is what I got
## Reasoning
Its currently first day of my winter brak and besides my day job I am going to have enough freetime to push
for the launch of LiftLog which is a no nonsense Progressive overload tracker. I also have a few other goals
like reading *competitive programmers handbook by Antti Laaksonen 2018* to understand more about design and
implementation of algorithms, updating my resume, and applying to as many internships as I can as a sophomore.

Anyway I wanted a centeral location where I can marker myself and my progress with my goals.
Also always wanted to have a old school blog lol

## Design
To make it feel cool and not take it to seriously I wanted a Unique UI at the very least since the plan was to mostly vibecode this. Thats why I ended up with the Xbox360 because I still play to this day and just absoloutly love the design.

## Tools Used
- HTML/CSS/JS - Basic Web Dev
- Markdown - For Blog Posts
I have no experience with web dev besides making a pure HTML site it highschool coding class. I didnt want to use a premade template either so I started the only way I knew how basically just 3 files described above and its deployed through github pages

## My Experience
Honestly It was a headache and I spent way more than I anticipated (~4 hours) and its not even fully functional yet lol. I thought I was going to type in a few prompts and it was gonna be perfect but nope... Maybe I am just not a goated prompt engineer. However to counterpoint all I used was claude AI free on the web and was copy and pasting and occasioanlly making changes from the errors it produced/ features i wanted to code myself. Honestly was not a fun experience and I really would need to learn actual HTML JS and other frameworks if I ever did wanna attempt another project but this website will serve its purpose well. I am actually not sure either if this website is "secure" meaning I dont think anything on here needs to be "secure" but idk if someone can hack me or something with anythign on here lol currently I am focused on Swift code development and C++ so I really dont care to much now but I should be fine 👀...
