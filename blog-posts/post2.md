# Why I Hate Modern Day App Price models
When I look at the App Store today, I see a lot of apps that are either free with in-app purchases or subscription-based. While this model works for many developers, I personally find it frustrating as a user. Here are a few reasons why:
1. Execues To Add BS AI Crap: The most common justification for having these subscription is for the use of AI and specifically with workout apps I feel like 90 percent of people who consistently workout dont want some AI slop insights on their workouts, especially for no nonsense lifters who just need a place to log their data and progressivly overload. I never even use that stuff yet in order to use basic features I need to have some PRO subscription that is basically just AI pop up ads to ask it questions
2. Data collection and selling data: Everyone is aware that we are being manipulated using our data and workout subscription/data is just another thing the algorithms are feed to cater your app feeds to get you to spend more time + money on apps that pay for your data. I dont want that it erks me how much they manipulate stuff to get you to buy
3. Spam emails every 3 days: Look clearly that shit works or they wouldnt be doing it I just as an individual hate seeing my email spammed with adds everyday to buy this or upgrade your subscribtion and I have emails from apps I used 3 years ago that i stupidly gave my email to just because I didnt want to pay money/ was forced to create an account
4. BS "Catering" Questions: This oe is fitness app specific but gad damn every single fitness app asks you a million questions just to ask you to buy sometihn or create an accout or to do something or both or extra stuff

## How I am approaching it
My app has no analytics tracking, no subscriptions, or no in-app purchases. I am charging an upfront fee and nothing else. While this might not translate to as much initial leads which means a smaller userbase I am okay with that as long as I stick to my guts and provide a service I think is fair. I will not collect an OUNCE of info and will never do any of the things I complain about above. I am providing a single service thats simple and straightforward and I promise to keep that sentiment and that is why I think this app will provide good value: Workout tracking for progressive overload and nothing more and nothing less. I will not release it if I feel that will not be deilivered.
